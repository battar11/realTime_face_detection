# realTime_face_detection
faces detection using open cv in python, I used open sourse model. 

STEPS TO DO THE TASK:

1 - install open cv using this command pip install opencv-python. 

2- add the model attached to your project in python. 

3- the code also attached. 

4- this way works in gray scale only.

NOTE: this is real time detection however, you can use it on videos and pics by repleacing this part of the code: cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) with image = cv2.imread('the name of the image')

the image you are detecting must be in project.
